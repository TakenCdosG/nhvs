            <h1>Renovation Roadmap</h1>
    
    <p>NHR Properties purchased Premiere Hotel and Suites in January 2015. Renovations inmediately began to transform the hotel from a state of neglect to an attractive, well designed community.</p>

    <div class="season-content-wrapper">
        <div class="season-bar"><h2>SPRING 2016</h2></div>
        <div class="season-bar-content">
            <h4>LANDSCAPING</h4>
            <p>Flowers, grass, plants, shrubs, and trees were installed to add curb appeal and create pleasant setting.</p>
            <h4>LIGHTING</h4>
            <p>Additional LED outdoor lighting was added along the pathways to allow guests to easily navigate through the community in the evening hours.</p>
            <h4>CLUB HOUSE</h4>
            <p>This central area of the hotel, once referred as the Gate House, looked worn-out and dated with carpet, dark brown trim and maroon color scheme. The room's design was freshened up by installing updated flooring, reupholstering the dining chairs to coordinate with the new hotel colors, applying fresh paint and purchasing new sofas and end tables.</p>
            <h4>EXTERIOR PAINT</h4>
            <p>Each residential building was painted with a brand new color palate to freshen up the buildings' appearance.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="season-bar"><h2>SUMMER 2016</h2></div>
        <div class="season-bar-content">
            <h4>OUTDOOR COURTYARDS</h4>
            <p>Three communal outdoor living spaces were crafted for guests to enjoy.</p>
            <ul class="rrmap-list">
                <li><span>Club House Courtyard</span></li>
                <p>The original outdoor patio attached to the Club House was expanded from 650 square feet to 2,400 square feet. The existing concrete was replaced with decorative pavers and new landscaping was installed along with a gas fire pit and comfortable outdoor seating.</p>
                <li><span>Upper Veranda</span></li>
                <p>A new addition to the community, this patio is located on an upper level off the Club House Courtyad. Maintaining the same design theme, this outdoor area hosts a series of dining sets with umbrellas along with manicured landscaping to create a shaded, refreshing ambiance.</p>
                <li><span>Picnic and Game Courtyard</span></li>
                <p>A bocce court has been installed along with a gas grill cooking station, replacing the original baskeetball court. In addition, comfortable outdoor seating was added for guests to enjoy outdoor dining.</p>
            </ul>
            <h4>FENCING</h4>
            <p>The 3-foot picket fence that separated the community from the parking lot was replaced with a 6-foot fence to add privacy and security,</p>
            <h4>BOOM CONTROL GATE</h4>
            <p>Installation of boom barriers with key card access control allow guest-only parking, increase security and reduce noise.</p>
            <h4>SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS</h4>
            <p>Twenty-four additional mega pixel cameras were added to deter misconduct and assist with monitoring community grounds.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="season-bar"><h2>FALL 2016</h2></div>
        <div class="season-bar-content">
            <h4>FIBER OPTICS INSTALLATION</h4>
            <p>The existing wiring system is over 12-years-old, causing slow speeds and connectivity issues with the Internet. Fiber optics are being installed by Comcast throughout the community to provide high speeds and high quality Internet service. Additionally, repeaters are being added to increase signal strength for in-room WiFi and provide constact connectivity for guests' smart devices.</p>
            <h4>ADA RENOVATIONS</h4>
            <p>Seven rooms are being renovated to meet 2010 Federal ADA Compliance Standards, including adding an elevator to make the second floor accesible. In addition, the Club House lobby and bathrooms were renovated to become ADA Compliant.</p>
            <h4>PARKING AREA REPAVING</h4>
            <p>Plans to repave and restripe the parking area to add 10 additional spaces are underway.</p>
            <h4>SUITE RENOVATIONS</h4>
            <p>Approximately one quarter of our suites have been updated, with the following features.
